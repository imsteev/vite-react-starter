# Vite React Starter

```
bun install
bun dev
```

Alternatively, you can use [`bun create`](https://bun.sh/docs/cli/bun-create#from-github) to skip having to clone this repo
```
bun create github.com/imsteev/vite-react-starter your-project-name
cd your-project-name
bun dev
```

At time of creation, was using Bun v1.1.27.
